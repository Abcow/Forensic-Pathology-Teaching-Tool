Three things I still have no idea what they said, highlighted with ****
Also yes, he's a manager of a pig factory.


Good Morning, This is DI Pullan, May I speak to Dr Yap at the Forensic Pathology Department?
Currently Speaking.
Good, I was just ringing to inform you of a suspicious death in the **BROOKE?** area of Cardiff last night. Okay, go on.
The deceased was identified as Marvin Settler, he was a 34 year old male he was found this morning at around 7:30am slumped against and alley wall near to his house. Although cold to the touch, and pulseless, the woman who found him rang an ambulance and began CPR. She had been trained in basic life support. The ambulance crew however pronounced the man dead at the scene, and due to the circumstance of his death, I thought it best to involve you as quickly as we could in this investigation.
I see, hmm, when was the individual last seen?
Around 2:30 we think, thatâ€™s the same morning. He was leaving live lounge at the time, and we believe he began to walk home but did not make it. A witness **no idea what this word is** reports fighting between two individuals, one of whom fits his description, and he does have some injuries vindictive of fight.
And what do we know of Mr Settler?
We know he has a large social network, but only one remaining living relative, his Mother, who we have informed of this tragic death, he has no criminal record, and is the manager of a local pig factory, we are in the process of taking statements from his co-workers. In relation to the evening, we know he was drunk, but his friends believe he had not taken any drugs.
Do we know if Mr Settler has any medical History?
He had asthma when young, but that was controlled, and he also broke his leg when he was 16. Okay, thank you, is the body still at the scene of death?
It is, yes.
Hmm, where and when would you like to meet then?
Would 1pm today work for you? On **something something** road.
Yes, that sounds good, okay brilliant, thank you!
