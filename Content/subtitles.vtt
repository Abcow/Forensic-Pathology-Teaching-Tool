00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
Good Morning, this is DI Pullan,

2
00:14.001 --> 00:17.000
may I speak to Dr Yap of the forensic pathology department.  

3
00:17.001 --> 00:19.000
Currently speaking. 

4
00:19.001 --> 00:20.000
Ah, good. I was just ringing you to inform you of

5
00:20.001 --> 00:23.000
a suspicious death in the Roath area of Cardiff, last night.

6
00:23.001 --> 00:25.000
O.K. Go on.  

7
00:25.001 --> 00:27.000
The deceased was identified as Marvin Settler.

8
00:27.001 --> 00:29.000
He is a thirty four year old male,

9
00:29.001 --> 00:32.000
who was found this morning at 7:30 AM,

10
00:32.001 --> 00:34.000
slumped against an alley wall near to his house.

11
00:34.001 --> 00:37.000
Although was cold to the touch and pulseless,

12
00:37.001 --> 00:38.000
the woman who found him rang an ambulance and began CPR. 

13
00:38.001 --> 00:42.000
She has been trained in basic life support. 

14
00:42.001 --> 00:45.000
The ambulance crew pronounced the man dead at the scene,

15
00:45.001 --> 00:46.000
and due to the circumstances of his death we thought

16
00:46.001 --> 00:48.000
it best to involve you as quickly

17
00:48.001 --> 00:49.000
as we could in this investigation.

18
00:50.001 --> 00:51.000
I see. 

19
00:51.001 --> 00:53.000
When was the individual last seen? 

20
00:54.001 --> 00:57.000
Around 2:30, we think, that same morning,

21
00:57.001 --> 01:02.000
he was leaving Live Lounge at the time.

22
01:02.001 --> 01:03.000
And we believe he began walking home,

23
01:03.001 --> 01:05.000
but did not make it.

24
01:05.001 --> 01:08.000
Witness bystanders report of fighting between two individuals,

25
01:08.001 --> 01:10.000
one of whom fits his description.

26
01:10.001 --> 01:13.000
and he does have some injuries indicative of a fight.  

27
01:13.001 --> 01:16.000
And what do we know of Mr Settler? 

28
01:16.001 --> 01:17.000
We know he has a large social network,

29
01:17.001 --> 01:18.000
but only one remaining living relative,

30
01:20.001 --> 01:24.000
his Mother, whom we have informed of this tragic death.

31
01:24.001 --> 01:26.000
He has no criminal record.

32
01:26.001 --> 01:28.000
And is the manager of a local cake factory,

33
01:18.001 --> 01:31.000
and we are in the process of taking statements from his co-workers.

34
01:31.001 --> 01:34.000
In relation to the evening, we know he was drunk

35
01:34.001 --> 01:36.000
but his friends believe he had not taken any drugs.

36
01:36.001 --> 01:40.000
Do we know if Mr Settler has any medical history?

37
01:40.001 --> 01:43.000
He had asthma when young, but that was controlled.

38
01:43.001 --> 01:46.000
and he also broke his leg when he was sixteen.

39
01:46.001 --> 01:47.000
O.K Thank you.

40
01:47.001 --> 01:49.000
Is the body still at the scene of death? 

41
01:49.001 --> 01:51.000
It is yes.

42
01:51.001 --> 01:55.000
Where and when would you like to meet then? 

43
01:55.001 --> 01:59.000
Would 1:00PM today work for you? Queensbury Road, Roath?

44
01:59.001 --> 02:01.000
Yes, that sounds good

45
02:01.001 --> 02:03.000
O.K, brilliant, thank you!
