0:11 Good Morning, this is DI Pullan,
0:14 may I speak to Dr Yap of the forensic pathology department.  

0:17 Currently speaking. 

0:19 Ah, good. I was just ringing you to inform you of
0:20 a suspicious death in the Roath area of Cardiff, last night.

0:23 O.K. Go on.  

0:25 The deceased was identified as Marvin Settler. 
0:27 He is a thirty four year old male,
0:29 who was found this morning at 7:30 AM, 
0:32 slumped against an alley wall near to his house. 
0:34 Although was cold to the touch and pulseless,
0:37 the woman who found him rang an ambulance and began CPR. 
0:38 She has been trained in basic life support. 
0:42 The ambulance crew pronounced the man dead at the scene,
0:45 and due to the circumstances of his death we thought
0:46 it best to involve you as quickly
0:48 as we could in this investigation.  

0:50 I see. 
0:51 When was the individual last seen? 

0:54 Around 2:30, we think, that same morning,
0:57 he was leaving Live Lounge at the time.
1:02 And we believe he began walking home,
1:03 but did not make it.
1:05 Witness bystanders report of fighting between two individuals,
1:08 one of whom fits his description.
1:10 and he does have some injuries indicative of a fight.  

1:13 And what do we know of Mr Settler? 

1:16 We know he has a large social network,
1:17 but only one remaining living relative,
1:20 his Mother, whom we have informed of this tragic death.
1:24 He has no criminal record.
1:26 And is the manager of a local cake factory,
1:28 and we are in the process of taking statements from his co-workers.
1:31 In relation to the evening, we know he was drunk
1:34 but his friends believe he had not taken any drugs.

1:36 Do we know if Mr Settler has any medical history?

1:40 He had asthma when young, but that was controlled.
1:43 and he also broke his leg when he was sixteen.

1:46 O.K Thank you.
1:47 Is the body still at the scene of death? 

1:49 It is yes.

1:51 Where and when would you like to meet then? 

1:55 Would 1:00PM today work for you? Queensbury Road, Roath?

1:59 Yes, that sounds good

2:01 O.K, brilliant, thank you!
