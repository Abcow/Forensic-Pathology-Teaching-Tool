	<title>Forensic Pathology Teaching Tool</title>
	<subtitle>About this Project</subtitle>
	<text>This resource has been created to give you a basic understanding of forensic pathology. It will guide you through the forensic process from the initial crime scene to the autopsy, toxicology and histology. 
</text>
	<text>Following this guidance you will begin your own case, trying to ascertain the cause of death. I hope you enjoy using this as much as we did making it.
